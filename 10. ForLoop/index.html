    <h3>For...in Loop</h3>
    <p>The "for...in" loop in JavaScript is used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object.</p>
    <p>It is a way to loop through the keys (property names) of an object.</p>
    <p>for (let key in object) {...}</p>

    <h3>For...of loop</h3>
    <p>The "for...of" loop in JavaScript is a modern iteration statement introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) that provides a concise and easy way to loop over elements in iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, sets and more.</p>
    <p>It allows you to iterate directly over the values of the elements, rather than dealing with their indices or keys, which makes the code more readable and less error-prone.</p>
    <p>for (variable of iterable) {...}</p>

    <h3>ForEach loop</h3>
    <p>When we call the forEach helper we pass in anonymous callback function</p>
    <p>This function gets called one time for every element in the array</p>
    <p>Whatever is inside the function that logic happens</p>
