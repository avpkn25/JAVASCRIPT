    <h1>Map Helper</h1>
    <p>The map() method created a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.</p>

    <h1>Filter Helper</h1>
    <p>The filter() method is a built-in array method in JavaScript that allows you to create a new array containing elements that pass a certain condition.</p>
    <p>It provides a clean and concise way to filter out elements from an array based on a specified criteria.</p>

    <h1>Find Helper</h1>
    <p>The find() method is another built-in array helper in JavaScript that allows you to find the first element in an array that matches a specific condition.</p>
    <p>It returns the value of the first element that satisfies the given testing function, or undefined if no element is found.</p>

    <h1>Every & Some Helper</h1>
    <p>The every() and some() are two built-in array methods in JavaScript that allow you to check the elements of an array based on a given condition.</p>
    <p>Both methods take a callback function as an argument, which is applied to each element of the array.</p>

    <h3>Every Helper</h3>
    <p>The every() method tests whether all elements in the array pass the condition specified by the provided callback function.</p>
    <p>It returns true if the callback function returns true for every element, and false if any element fails the condition.</p>

    <h3>Some Helper</h3>
    <p>The some() method tests whether at least one element in the array passes the condition specified by the provided callback function.</p>
    <p>It returns true if the callback function returns true for at least one element and false if no element passes the condition.</p>

    <h1>Reduce Helper</h1>
    <p>The reduce() method applies the reducer function to each element of an array, accumulating the results into a single value.</p>
    <p>Is is often used to perform calculations or aggregations on array elements and simplify the array into a single value.</p>
