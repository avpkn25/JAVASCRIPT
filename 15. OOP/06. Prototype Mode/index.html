    <h1>Prototype Model</h1>
    <p>Every JavaScript object has a anonymous property called prototype</p>
    <p>Remember function & arrays are also a object</p>
    <p>That prototype will be the parent of that object, prototype property is object by itself, which have some special properties & methods.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Every object is associated with another object.</p>
    <p>The object (obj) is associated with [[Prototype]] Object</p>
    <p>-> which means obj object will inherit all properties of Object.prototype || [[Prototype]]</p>

    <br>
    <p>We can check the prototype of something in 3 ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>obj.__proto__</li>
        <li>obj.constructor.prototype</li>
        <li>Object.getPrototypeOf(a)</li>
    </ul>
