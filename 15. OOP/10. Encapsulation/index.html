    <h1>Encapsulation</h1>
    <p>Encapsulation is the concept of building data (properties) and methods (functions) together within an object, allowing the object to control access to its internal data and behaviour.</p>
    <p>This helps to hide implementation details and expose only necessary interfaces to interact with the object.</p>
    <p>In JavaScript, you can achieve encapsulation by using closures, symbols, or naming conventions to simulate private members and expose public interfaces.</p>
