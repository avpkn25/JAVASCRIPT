    <h1>Polymorphism</h1>
    <p>Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, even if thet are instances of a subclass.</p>
    <p>This facilitates writing code that works with different types of objects in a generic way.</p>
    <p>In JavaScript, polymorphysm is achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class.</p>
    <p>The code can then use same method to work with both parent and subclass instances</p>
