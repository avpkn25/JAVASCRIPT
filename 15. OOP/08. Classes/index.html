    <h1>Classes</h1>
    <p>Classes are one of the featurs introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript</p>
    <p>A Class is a blueprint for the object. You can create an object from the class.</p>
    <p>You can think of the class as a sketch (prototype) of a house.</p>
    <p>It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc..</p>
    <p>Based on these descriptions, you can build the house.</p>

    <p>Sine many houses can be made from the same description, we can create many objects from a class.</p>
