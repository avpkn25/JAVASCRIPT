    <h1>Class Modifiers</h1>
    <p>Class modifiers, also known as access modifiers or visibility modifiers, are keywords in OOP languages that define the visibility or accessibility of class members(fields, methods, and nested classes) from other parts of the program.</p>
    <p>They control the level of encapsulation and help enforce encapsulation principles by restricting direct access to certain class members.</p>

    <br>
    <p>In JavaScript, class modifiers are used in the context of classes and objects, although JavaScript does not have traditional access modifiers like some other object-oriented languages (e.g. Java).</p>
    <p>However, you can achieve similar effects using different conventions and techniques.</p>
