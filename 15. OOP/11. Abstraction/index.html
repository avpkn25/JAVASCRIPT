    <h1>Abstraction</h1>
    <p>Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, manageble parts.</p>
    <p>It allows you to focus on the essential features of an object and hide unnecessary details.</p>
    <p>In JavaScript, you can use abstract classes to define abstract structures and then implement them in concrete objects.</p>
