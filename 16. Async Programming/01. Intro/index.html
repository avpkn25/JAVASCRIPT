    <h2>Synchronous (sync)</h2>
    <p>Synchronous JavaScript refers to the traditional way of executing JavaScript code, where each operation is performed in a sequential and blocking manner.</p>
    <p>In other words, each line of code is executed one after the other and the program will wait for each operation to finish before moving on to the next one.</p>
    <p>If an operation takes a long time to complete, it can potentially slow down the entire application, making it less responsive.</p>
    
    <br>
    <h2>Asynchronous (async)</h2>
    <p>Asynchronous JavaScript allows certain operations to be executed Independently from the main program flow, so they don't block the execution of other tasks.</p>
    <p>This is typically achieved using techniques like callbacks, promise and async/await, which allow developers to handle asynchronous operations more efficiently.</p>
