    <h1>Spread Operators</h1>
    <p>The Spread operator is a new addition to the set of operators in JavaScript ES6.</p>
    <p>It takes in an iterable (e.g an array) and expands it into individual elements.</p>
    <p>The spread operator is commonly used to make shallow copies of JS objects.</p>
    <p>Using this operator makes the code concise and enhance its readability.</p>

    <h1>Rest Operator</h1>
    <p>The rest parameter syntax allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments</p>
    <p>as an array, providing a way to represent variadic fucntions in JavaScript</p>

    <h1>Ternary Operator</h1>
    <p>The ternary operator in JavaScript is a concise way of writing conditional expressions.</p>
    <p>It is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: </p>
    <p>i. A condition followed by a question mark (?)</p>
    <p>ii. An expression to execute if the condition is true, followed by a colon (:)</p>
    <p>and an expression to execute if the condition is false</p>
    <p>condition ? trueExpression : falseExpression</p>
