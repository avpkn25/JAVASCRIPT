    <h1>Template Strings</h1>
    <p>Template Strings, also known as template literals, are a feature in JavaScript that allows you to create strings with embedded expressions.</p>
    <p>They are denoted by backticks `` instead of single or double quotes.</p>
    <p>Template strings provide a more flexible and concise way to construct strings, especially when they involve variables or expressions</p>
