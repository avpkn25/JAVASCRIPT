variables

const -> variable can't maniulate further. when we declare a variable using const, we can change the value of that further.
var -> variable can maniulate further
let -> variable can maniulate further
-> can't write reserved keywords as variables
-> can't use space in between variables
-> can't use numbers in starting of the variables
-> can't use '-' symbol in between variables. js conpiler thinks that the second value is seperating from the first value which is not valid thing.
-> can use _, $ in starting of the variable decleration
-> can use _ in between the variables

Naming conventions for variables
use camelCase naming convension to look good js code

Primitive types
1. numbers
2. boolean -> true | false
=> number + undefined -> NaN
falsy values
    -> false
    -> null
    -> 0
    -> -0
    -> NaN
    -> '', "", ``, (empty quotes)
other all are true values

difference between null and undefined?
null is set by developers and undefined is set by js compiler
