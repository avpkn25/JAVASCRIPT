    <h1>Map Data Structure</h1>
    <p>Map is a built-in data structure introduced in (ES6) that allows you to store key-value pairs where both the keys and values can be of any data type.</p>
    <p>It is similar to an object, but with a few key differences:</p>
    <p>-> Keys can be of any data type: Unlike objects, where keys are limited to strings and symbols, Map allows you to use any data type as keys, including numbers, booleans, objects and even Map instances.</p>
    <p>-> Maintains insertion order: Map preserves the order of key-value pairs as they were inserted, while object keys may not be guaranteed to be in a specific order.</p>
    <p>-> Insertion: Map provides built-in methods for easy iteration over its elements.</p>

    <h1>Set Data Structure</h1>
    <p>Set is a built-in data structure introduced in (ES6) that represents a collection of unique values.</p>
    <p>Unlike arrays, Set allows you to store only unique values, which means duplicate values are automatically removed.</p>
    <p>Each value can occur only once within a Set</p>
    <p>Set objects are useful when you need to store to a list of unique elements and quickly check for the existence of a specific value.</p>

    <h1>Symbols</h1>
    <p>Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive datatype introduced in ECMAScript (ES6).</p>
    <p>A Symbol is often used as an identifier for object properties to avoid potential naming conflicts.</p>
    <p>Unlike strings or numbers, symbols are guaranteed to be unique.</p>
    <p>When you create a symbol, it is unique and cannot be recreated or changed.</p>
    <p>This uniqueness ensures that symbols will not collide with other property names, even if thhey have the same string representation.</p>
